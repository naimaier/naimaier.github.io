                The Data Collector is a desktop software that collect log entries from <i>.csv</i> log files 
                generated by the PLC. These entries can be filtered by a date and time span. 
                The data can be collected by one of three ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="project__text">
                    Via network: The PLC has a built-in ftp server to which the Data Collector can connect to 
                    and retrieve the log files.
                </li>
                <li class="project__text">
                    Via flash drive: The PLC has an USB port so it can export data to an external device. 
                    This option allows the Data Collector to read the files from this device, once plugged 
                    into the computer running it.
                </li>
                <li class="project__text">
                    Via backup: Every time the Data Collector retrieve a log file by any of the previous 
                    methods it automatically creates a backup in the local machine running the application. 
                    These backups are searcheable via this feature.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="project__text">
                The application then allows the user to export the resulting data to a <i>.xls</i> file.

            <p class="project__text">
                I first built this software using Java OpenJDK 12 and OpenJFX 12 and dependencies managed by Maven. 
                In a later version I changed it to JDK 1.8 so it could run on 32 bit systems.
            </p>
            <p class="project__text">
                In developing the software I used the <i>Template Method Design Pattern</i> to organize the actions 
                of importing data from several different sources, doing a general order of methods that would differ in 
                implementation according to each case.
            </p>
            <p class="project__text">
                I also used the <i>Strategy Pattern</i> to make it easy for future additions of PLC models and 
                exporting file formats.

                The Software is currently running in the industry and has received comments about it's 
                easy of use. It simplified the way the logs where collected and transformed in excel files before 
                (manually or using overly complicated software).
